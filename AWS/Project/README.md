Projects README

This section contains the working projects developed as part of my cloud training using Amazon Web Services.

Each project is placed in its own folder and represents a focused implementation of a specific cloud concept. These projects are not grouped as theory-based exercises. They are built through direct configuration and deployment in live environments.

The purpose of this section is to document:

 1. How individual cloud services are set up and used

2. The process followed during implementation

3. Practical challenges faced during deployment

4. The working outcome of each setup

Every project folder includes its own detailed README that explains the objective, approach, configuration steps, and results.

Together, these projects reflect hands-on experience in building and managing cloud-based systems with a structured and practical approach.
