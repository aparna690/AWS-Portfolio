Project Directory Overview

This folder contains the individual project work that forms the practical core of this AWS portfolio built on Amazon Web Services.

Each subfolder represents a separate implementation focused on a specific cloud function or deployment task. The projects are organised to reflect real learning progression across infrastructure setup, service configuration, access management, storage handling, and system deployment.

Within every project folder, you will find:
1. A brief project description
2. Architecture or setup context
3. Configuration steps followed
4. Key commands or service actions used
5. Screenshots for validation
6. Observations or outcomes

The purpose of this structure is to maintain clarity between different implementations while documenting how each component of a cloud environment is built and managed.

Together, these project files demonstrate applied understanding of cloud operations through direct execution rather than isolated theory.
