# AWS-Portfolio
This repository documents my practical training and growing technical ability in cloud computing using Amazon Web Services.

It brings together structured, hands-on work across core service areas such as compute infrastructure, storage, access management, networking basics, and system deployment. The projects included here reflect direct implementation of cloud concepts through configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting rather than simulated exercises.

1. The portfolio demonstrates familiarity with:

2. Cloud infrastructure setup and management

3. Identity and access control practices

4. Storage and volume handling

5. Basic networking and connectivity

6. Web service deployment environments

7.Scalability and availability concepts

Each section represents applied learning developed through lab work and guided implementation. The intention is to build a clear foundation in cloud operations while strengthening problem-solving ability in live environments.

This repository serves as a technical record of my progression toward entry-level cloud and DevOps roles, with an emphasis on practical understanding of how modern cloud systems are structured and maintained.
